"""
Programmable quantum Network Software Simulator (ProgReSS) is a package that implements a programmable quantum network
simulation environment.

It can be used to simulate quantum networks with programmable NET layer. The NET layer is
implemented using the PQ-NET internal framework. The PQ-NET framework is a framework that allows the user to implement
custom quantum network protocols by implementing custom modules that can be connected together to form a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG).
